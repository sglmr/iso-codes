# Country ISO Code Table

I'm always searching Google and <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>f</kbd>'ing my way to look up some random country code. Like Switzerland for example... 'CHE'? really? 

This is a quick little web page and JS I threw together to keep a searchable list of country ISO 3166-1 codes handy. It's hosted at [isocodes.sglmr.com]
